final

Variable - If a variable is declared as final, it's value can not be changed once assigned.
         Value is assigned at the time of declaration or in constructor. After that the value can not be changed.

Method - If final is the access modifier for a method, that method can not be overriden in child class.
           
Class -  If final is the access modifier for a Class, that class can not be inherited or extended.

Suppose Class is not final and still we don't want to have child class. Then make constructor as private.

E.g:
Class P {
 private P(){};
}  
Now, the Class P can not have a child class or can not be extended. Why?
Because, every time we make child class object, Parent class default constructor is called. 
So, If P be the parent class, it's constructor is private which can not be accessed.

Therefore a class having private constructor, we can not create any child class,
