
Singleton Pattern

Singleton pattern says just
 "define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".
In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be
used by all other classes. 

Advantage of using singleton design pattern is that -
It saves memory because object is not created at each request. 
Only single instance is reused again and again.

Singleton class should have public visibility so that complete application can use.

Two approaches
1. Early instantiation - object created at the beginnig.
2. Lazy instantiation - object created when first request comes.
