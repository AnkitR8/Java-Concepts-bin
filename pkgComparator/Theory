
java.util.comparator 
We need to use comparator interface when we want to order objects on different attributes.
For example, I want to order employee objects on the Salary basis or on name basis or grade basis.


The compare(object o1, object o2) method of comparator interface needs to be implemented for this purpose.

It compares two objects and returns an integer depending upon the comparison:
positive if o1 is greater than o2
zero if o1 equals o2
negative if o1 less than o2

another interface which is used for sorting objects is java.lang.comparable
But comparable can not sort objects on different attributes. 

Here, we will work with comparator interface.
