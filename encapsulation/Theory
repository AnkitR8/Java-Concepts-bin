
Encapsulation - In Java, Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting 
on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, 
the variables of a class will be hidden from the other classes and can be accessed only through 
the methods of their current class. It is also known as Data hiding.
To achieve Encapsulation in Java, 
-Declare the variables of class as Private. 
-Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the variables.

A class is said to be tightly Encapsulated if each and every variable declared as private.
